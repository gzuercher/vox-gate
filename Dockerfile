# pyproject.toml is the single source of truth for runtime deps. Files
# referenced by [tool.setuptools] (server.py via py-modules, auth/ via
# packages) must be present for `pip install .` to succeed, so they are
# copied before the install. BuildKit cache mount keeps pip's wheel
# cache between builds — app-code changes that invalidate this layer do
# not re-download dependencies.
