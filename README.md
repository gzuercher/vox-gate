# VoxGate

**Talk to Claude (or another chatbot) by voice — straight from your phone.**

VoxGate is a small web app you install on your phone home screen like a
native app. Tap the mic, speak, and hear the answer read back to you.
Recognizes standard German and French; the UI defaults to the Swiss
locales `de-CH` and `fr-CH`.

## What do you want to do?

### A) Talk to Claude by voice — own (sub-)domain

Recommended path. You need a subdomain pointing at your server and an
Anthropic API key.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gzuercher/vox-gate.git
cd vox-gate/deploy/caddy
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: VOXGATE_DOMAIN, ACME_EMAIL, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d
```

Caddy fetches a Let's Encrypt certificate automatically. Details:
[`deploy/caddy/README.md`](deploy/caddy/README.md).

### B) Reach your own bot by voice (e.g. a planner)

Same setup as A, but instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` you set
`TARGET_URL` pointing at your backend. Your backend implements a small
HTTP contract — see [`docs/backends.md`](docs/backends.md).

### C) Existing reverse-proxy infra (Traefik, Kubernetes, nginx)

Use the root `docker-compose.yml`. It only ships the VoxGate container;
cert handling and hostname routing happen in your infra. Notes:
[`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md#reverse-proxy).

### D) No domain of your own (Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale Funnel)

VoxGate works behind any tunnel — Cloudflare or Tailscale provide HTTPS
and a hostname. Concept and pointers to the official setups:
[`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md#tunnel-in-front).

## Using the app

After installing the PWA on your home screen, open it:

| Element | Function |
|---|---|
| **Mic button (large)** | Tap to start recording. Tap again to send. |
| **Language (top left)** | Switch between `DE-CH` and `FR-CH`. Persisted. |
| **Speaker (top right)** | Mute/unmute speech output. |
| **Status dot (top right)** | Green = ready, blinking = sending, red = error. |
| **New conversation (bottom)** | Reset the conversation history. |

Replies are read aloud automatically unless muted. If you tap the mic
again while audio is playing, the current speech is cancelled.

### Requirements

- **Browser:** Chrome on Android or desktop (Web Speech API).
  Safari/iOS support is limited.
- **Microphone permission** must be granted on first launch.
- **HTTPS** is mandatory on Android — solved by Caddy/tunnel above.

## Installing the PWA on your phone

1. Open Chrome on Android → `https://your-voxgate-host`.
2. Three-dot menu → "Add to Home screen".
3. The app now opens like any other app, with its own icon and color.

If you deploy multiple instances on different hostnames, repeat for
each — every URL becomes its own PWA with its own color.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| Mic doesn't react | Grant permission in the browser. On Android the page must be HTTPS. |
| No speech output | Check the speaker button. iOS has limited Web Speech support. |
| `401` error | Bearer token missing or wrong — see operator/.env. |
| `429` error | Rate limit hit. Wait and retry. |
| `503` on `/claude` | Anthropic backend not configured — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| Conversation suddenly "forgets" | Server restart — sessions are in-memory by design. |
| Doesn't work on Safari/iOS | Web Speech API is limited there; use Chrome. |

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐                             ┌──────────────────┐
│  PWA        │     POST /claude            │                  │     Anthropic API

│  screen)    │                             │                  │
│             │     POST /prompt            │                  │     POST TARGET_URL
│             │  ────────────────────────►  │                  │  ────────────────────►  Custom backend
│             │  ◄────────────────────────  │                  │  ◄────────────────────  (e.g. zursetti-planner)
└─────────────┘                             └──────────────────┘
```

The server exposes two endpoints:

- **`/claude`** — calls the Anthropic API directly. Keeps conversation
  history per session. Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- **`/prompt`** — forwards to a custom backend (`TARGET_URL`).
  Stateless. Voice gateway for any chatbot service.

## API reference

### `POST /claude`

```json
POST /claude
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "What time is it in Tokyo?",
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

Response: `{ "response": "Currently it's …" }`

`session_id` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,128}$`. Up to 20 messages
per session are kept in memory; older ones are dropped in pairs.

### `POST /prompt`

```json
POST /prompt
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "text": "Hello backend" }
```

VoxGate forwards to `TARGET_URL` and expects JSON with a `response`
(or `text`) field back.

### `GET /config`

Returns instance configuration for the PWA. No auth.

```json
{ "name": "Claude", "color": "#c8ff00", "lang": "de-CH", "maxLength": 4000 }
```

### Errors

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 401 | Token missing or wrong |
| 422 | Validation failed |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 502 | Backend error |
| 503 | Backend not configured |
