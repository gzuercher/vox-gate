## What is VoxGate?

A small voice-frontend PWA with a Google-Sign-In auth gate. Every
authenticated request is forwarded as a JSON POST to a backend you
configure via `TARGET_URL`. VoxGate has **no built-in LLM integration**
— the backend at `TARGET_URL` owns all chat logic (system prompts,
model selection, history, routing, tool calls).

If you are implementing that backend, the strict contract is below.
If you are running VoxGate, see the cheatsheet of other endpoints
right after.

## Endpoint map (all there is)

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | none | The PWA itself, plus every static asset under it (`/app.js`, `/auth.js`, `/styles.css`, `/manifest.json`, `/icon.svg`, `/sw.js`, `/platform.js`, `/debug.js`) |
| `/integration` | GET | none | This page (markdown) |
| `/config` | GET | none | PWA config — branding, languages, Google client ID, max prompt length. JSON. |
| `/openapi.json` | GET | none | OpenAPI spec for VoxGate's HTTP surface (machine-readable) |
| `/docs` | GET | none | Interactive Swagger UI for the same spec |
| `/redoc` | GET | none | Alternative ReDoc rendering of the same spec |
| `/chat` | POST | session cookie + CSRF | The one endpoint the PWA calls for every chat turn. Body: `{text, session_id, lang}`. Returns `{response}`. Forwards to `TARGET_URL` using the contract below. |
| `/auth/login/{provider}` | POST | none (origin-checked, rate-limited) | Exchange a provider ID token for a VoxGate session. Today only `provider=google`. Returns `429` after `AUTH_LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default 10/min/IP). |
| `/auth/logout` | POST | session + CSRF (when logged in) | Clears session and CSRF cookies. Idempotent. |
| `/auth/me` | GET | session cookie | `{email, provider}` of the signed-in user, or 401. |
| `/auth/providers` | GET | none | `{providers: [...]}` — identity providers this instance has registered. |
| `/debug-log` | POST | `X-Debug-Token` | 404 unless `DEBUG_ENABLED=1`. PWA opt-in diagnostics overlay. |

That's the entire surface. If you need anything else, you're guessing.

**No dedicated health-check endpoint.** Probes should hit `GET /config`
— it is cheap, requires no auth, and exercises the real request path
(middleware, CSP headers, JSON serialisation). A 200 there means the
process is alive and serving.

## Where to find the rest

Everything below is in the source repository, not at runtime. Pointers
are listed here so a backend integrator does not need to crawl the
repo:

- **Operator setup, env vars, reverse-proxy patterns:**
  [`docs/setup.md`](setup.md) in the repo.
- **Operator security checklist:** [`docs/security.md`](security.md).
- **Example backend implementations** (FastAPI, Express, bash, an
  Anthropic adapter you can use as `TARGET_URL` to get voice-to-Claude
  back without re-introducing it into VoxGate itself):
  [`docs/backends.md`](backends.md).
- **Roadmap and explicit non-goals:** [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).
- **Contributing guide:** [`docs/contributing.md`](contributing.md).
- **PWA usage from the user's perspective:** the
  [project README](../README.md).

# Backend contract

This section is the **strict** contract between VoxGate and the
backend at `TARGET_URL`. Any deviation surfaces as a `502` to the PWA.

## Request: VoxGate → backend

`POST <TARGET_URL>` with `Content-Type: application/json`. If
`TARGET_TOKEN` is configured, an `Authorization: Bearer <TARGET_TOKEN>`
header is added. Outbound timeout is `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` seconds
(default 120).

```json
{
  "user":        "<text the user typed or spoke>",
  "user_email":  "<verified Google e-mail of the signed-in user>",
  "session_id":  "<opaque, client-generated, [A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,128}>",
  "metadata": {
    "lang":     "<BCP-47 tag the PWA was using, e.g. de-CH>",
    "instance": "<INSTANCE_NAME from VoxGate's .env>"
  }
}
```

Field semantics:

| Field | Trust | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | user-typed | Free text. Already validated for length (`MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH`, default 4000). |
| `user_email` | **server-injected, verified** | Authenticated by Google + allowlisted by the operator. Backends can rely on this for ACL decisions and *should not* trust any client-provided e-mail field. |
| `session_id` | client-generated | Opaque correlator. VoxGate keeps no state for it. The backend may use it as its own conversation key. |
| `metadata.lang` | client-set | The UI language at the moment of sending. May differ from `INSTANCE_NAME`'s default. Hint, not a guarantee. |
| `metadata.instance` | server-set | Useful when one backend serves multiple VoxGate instances (different families/contexts). |

Backends may receive additional `metadata.*` fields in future versions.
**Treat unknown fields as informational, do not reject them.**

## Response: backend → VoxGate

The backend must respond with HTTP 2xx **and** a JSON body of exactly
this shape:

```json
{ "response": "<assistant reply, plain string>" }
```

Strict rules:

- HTTP status `< 400`. `4xx` and `5xx` are forwarded as `502` to the
  PWA — the backend is the source of truth on what is or is not an
  error, but VoxGate intentionally collapses all backend errors into a
  single client-visible status.
- Body must be valid JSON. Plain-text responses are rejected.
- Body must be a JSON object (not an array, not a primitive).
- The object must contain key `"response"`.
- The value of `"response"` must be a string. Empty strings are
  allowed (e.g., the backend deliberately stays silent).

Anything else → VoxGate logs `backend_bad_shape` and returns `502`.

Additional keys in the response are tolerated but ignored — the PWA
sees only `{"response": ...}`. If you have metadata to surface in the
UI, propose extending the contract; do not stuff it into ad-hoc keys.

## Failure modes summary

| Backend behaviour | VoxGate response | Log line |
|---|---|---|
| Unreachable / connection refused / DNS fail / timeout | `502 Backend unreachable` | `backend_unreachable` |
| HTTP 4xx or 5xx | `502 Backend returned an error` | `backend_error` |
| Non-JSON body | `502 Backend response was not JSON` | `backend_non_json` |
| JSON without `response` string field | `502 Backend response did not match contract` | `backend_bad_shape` |

For completeness, the PWA can also see request-validation errors that
never reach the backend — `422` when `text` is empty/too long or
`session_id` does not match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,128}$`. Backends do not
need to handle these: VoxGate rejects the request before forwarding.

When debugging a 502, run on the VoxGate host:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail 30 vg | grep -E 'backend_(unreachable|error|non_json|bad_shape)'
```

The matching log line tells you exactly which clause was violated.

## Minimal reference backend (Python)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/")
async def chat(req: Request):
    body = await req.json()
    user = body["user"]
    email = body["user_email"]
    session = body["session_id"]
    # ... do whatever (LLM call, planner, lookup, …)
    return {"response": f"hello {email}, you said: {user}"}
```

Set `TARGET_URL=http://your-backend:port/` in the VoxGate `.env` and
you're talking. Richer examples (Express, bash stub, Anthropic
adapter): [`docs/backends.md`](backends.md) in the repo.

## Authentication boundary

By the time a request hits your backend, VoxGate has already:

- verified the user's Google ID token signature, issuer, audience and
  `email_verified` flag,
- matched the e-mail against the operator's `ALLOWED_EMAILS`,
- enforced the CSRF double-submit and (when configured) Origin check.

The backend can therefore trust `user_email` and treat the request as
an authorised action by that user. There is no shared bearer token to
verify on the backend side beyond the optional `TARGET_TOKEN` you set
yourself.

## Versioning

This document is not yet versioned — there has only ever been one
contract version (the one above). If a breaking change becomes
necessary, the response will gain a `voxgate-contract-version` HTTP
header and integrators will be notified before the change ships.
