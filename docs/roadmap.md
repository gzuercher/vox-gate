# Roadmap

Living document — ideas for future development. Nothing here is a
commitment. Each entry has a rough **value** (why bother) and
**cost/risk** (why it might hurt).

The goal of VoxGate is to stay a small, dependency-light voice
gateway. The current focus is to take VoxGate into **productive use**
and learn from real usage. Items are grouped by priority, not by
estimated time:

- **Höher** — clear value for productive use; pick from here first.
- **Normal** — useful, but not a precondition for productive use.
- **Deliberately not planned** — explicit rejections, with reasons.

---

## Höher

### Streaming responses (SSE)
- **Value:** backend replies start playing/showing within ~500 ms
  instead of after the full response. The single biggest
  perceived-quality win in the document — without it VoxGate feels
  noticeably slower than ChatGPT-style apps, and the gap grows with
  longer answers.
- **Cost:** **contract change.** Today the backend returns one JSON
  object; for streaming we'd extend the contract to allow SSE or
  chunked transfer-encoding from TARGET_URL, with VoxGate forwarding
  chunks to the PWA. Backends would need to opt in. PWA: incremental
  TTS plus text accumulation. The tricky part is making
  `speechSynthesis` speak partial sentences without sounding chopped.

### Additional identity providers (Microsoft, Apple, generic OIDC)
- **Value:** users without a Google account get a familiar option, and
  organisations on Microsoft 365 / Entra ID can plug their tenant in
  directly. The backend already routes through a `/auth/login/{provider}`
  endpoint with a generic verifier protocol, so additional providers
  slot in without a data-model change.
- **Cost:** per provider — register a generic OIDC verifier (issuer URL,
  audience, JWKS auto-fetch), wire a frontend button, extend the CSP for
  the new identity domain. ~1 working day per provider once the first
  non-Google one has been done.

### iOS Safari minimum support
- **Value:** unblock iPhone users who currently get a half-broken UX
  (Web Speech API is limited).
- **Cost:** at minimum: detect Safari, show a clear "open in Chrome"
  banner instead of silently failing. Going further (server-side STT
  fallback) is a separate item under Normal.

## Shipped

Items that used to live in the active sections above and are now in
production. Kept here briefly so old links resolve and the "what
shipped recently" question has an answer; full per-version detail
lives in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

- **Image / camera input** (2026-04-30). PWA captures or picks an
  image, downscales to 1600 px JPEG quality 0.85, base64-forwards via
  the `attachments[]` field of the `/chat` → TARGET_URL contract.
  One-way today (responses still match `{"response": "..."}`). Full
  contract: [`integration.md`](integration.md#attachments-one-way-client--backend).
- **Automatic dark/light mode** (2026-04-30). `<html data-theme>`
  drives the palette; the menu offers a 3-way Auto / Light / Dark
  picker that follows `prefers-color-scheme` in Auto.

---

## Normal

### Server-side STT fallback (Whisper)
- **Value:** unlocks iOS/Safari and any browser with weak Web Speech
  support. Vastly better recognition quality and dialect tolerance —
  a *real* answer to "Schwyzerdütsch erkennen".
- **Cost:** new external dependency (OpenAI Whisper API or a local
  whisper.cpp container). Audio upload path. Cost per request. Token
  privacy concerns. Optional via `STT_BACKEND=webspeech|whisper`.

### Server-side TTS (better voices)
- **Value:** device-installed voices are inconsistent. ElevenLabs /
  OpenAI TTS / Azure produce reliably good audio across phones.
- **Cost:** another external dependency, another API key, latency, per-
  request cost. Streaming support needed to keep perceived speed.

### Edge-pre-auth bundle
- **Value:** ship `deploy/caddy-private/` with Basic Auth or
  Cloudflare Access pre-wired for closed-group setups. Documents the
  pattern, removes guesswork.
- **Cost:** more bundles to maintain. Decide carefully whether docs
  alone (current state) are enough.

### Native mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- **Value:** access to platform STT (Apple's, Google's), better
  background behaviour, push notifications, real wake-word support.
- **Cost:** two new codebases to maintain. PWA-first philosophy
  abandoned. Probably only worth it if the user base demands it.

### Wake word ("Hey VoxGate")
- **Value:** hands-free triggering, true voice assistant feel.
- **Cost:** wake-word detection wants always-on mic, which a PWA
  cannot really do reliably. Native app dependency. Privacy theatre
  unless local — and local wake-word adds yet another dependency.

### Per-user UI settings (lang, voice, mute)
- **Value:** today these are device-local (`localStorage`). Multi-device
  users would benefit from server-side preferences keyed by
  `user_email`. Login already identifies users, so the foundation is
  in place.
- **Cost:** small server-side store (`/auth/me` extended with
  `preferences`), small settings UI in the PWA. Backend stays
  uninvolved — preferences are a VoxGate-only concern.

---

## Deliberately not planned

To keep the roadmap honest, here's what we are *not* going to do, and
why:

- **Built-in user accounts with passwords.** Out of scope. Login goes
  through external identity providers (Google today; OIDC for others
  later). Bringing in our own password reset, email verification, etc.
  is not core to "voice in, voice out".
- **Token in URL (`?key=…`) for easy sharing.** Security antipattern.
  Tokens leak via referer headers, browser history, and access logs.
- **Bundling cloudflared/Tailscale as docker-compose recipes.** The
  upstream tools have excellent setup UIs and docs. We point at them
  in `docs/setup.md` instead of duplicating moving targets.
- **Built-in MCP-server bridge.** Voice-driven tool execution would
  turn VoxGate from a small voice forwarder into a multi-round
  tool-use orchestrator with its own security perimeter, allowlists,
  and connection management. The right place for that complexity is
  the user's own `/chat` backend: it can speak MCP, do tool-use loops
  with the LLM internally, and hand VoxGate just the final reply.
  VoxGate stays small.
- **Built-in LLM integration (Claude/OpenAI/etc.).** Removed in
  the 2026-04-30 refactor. VoxGate is a voice + auth gateway, not an
  LLM client. If you want voice-to-Claude, run a small adapter
  container behind TARGET_URL — that pattern keeps the LLM choice,
  pricing, and credentials out of VoxGate entirely.
- **Local-only mode (Whisper.cpp + llama.cpp + Piper).** Different
  deployment story (model downloads, GPU/CPU choices, far lower
  reply quality), different audience, and a completely separate
  ops-and-update treadmill. If this is ever wanted, it is a sibling
  project ("VoxGate Local"), not a flag inside this one.
- **Plugin / skill ecosystem.** Plugin protocols, sandboxing,
  versioning, and distribution would turn VoxGate into a platform.
  Custom capabilities belong in the user's `/chat` backend, where
  they can be as small or as elaborate as needed without VoxGate
  carrying the maintenance.
- **Hosted SaaS offering.** Abuse handling, payment, GDPR, on-call —
  that is a different business, not a feature. VoxGate stays a thing
  you self-host.

## How to use this document

1. When picking work, prefer **Höher** over Normal unless there is an
   explicit reason to jump.
2. Before starting any item, write a short plan — the roadmap entry
   is not a spec.
3. When something here turns out to be a bad idea, delete it and
   record why. Stale items rot the document.
4. Add new ideas with the same value/cost framing. Vague ideas
   ("better UX") have no place here — be concrete.
5. If a Normal entry's own cost note disqualifies it ("would change
   what VoxGate is", "different business", "platform territory"), it
   does not belong on the roadmap — move it to *Deliberately not
   planned* or remove it.
